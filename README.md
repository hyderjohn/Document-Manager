# Document Management System

This is a web application for managing documents, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd doc-manager
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Since `node_modules` are not included in the repository, you need to install all the required packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically available at `http://localhost:5173` (check your terminal output for the exact address).

## Demo Credentials

You can use the following credentials to log in and test the application:

*   **Admin:**
    *   Email: `admin@example.com`
    *   Password: `admin123`
*   **User:**
